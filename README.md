# My name is Chandler Owen

# I am an EE major and graduate in april 2021. I am currently looking for entry level job for an EE. I love the Iot and embedded systems that are constantly #improving and becoming common in houses and buisnesses. I want to improve that field of technology even further. I like python and c/++. I hope to learn java and #many other languages.
